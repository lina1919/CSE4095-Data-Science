## Final Project
### Malware Detection in Network Traffic

This report presents an analysis of malware detection in network traffic, emphasizing the use of machine learning techniques to identify malicious activity. The motivation for the study stems from the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, highlighting the need for robust detection mechanisms. By leveraging labeled datasets, including malicious and benign network traffic, two machine learning classifiers—Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes—were trained and evaluated. 

The results indicate that while the SVM model demonstrated respectable accuracy, the Naive Bayes classifier outperformed it, achieving higher accuracy and better generalization. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, feature encoding, and cross-validation, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in enhancing cybersecurity, with a particular focus on proactive malware detection.
